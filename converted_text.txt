Not all support is strong enough for a bounce-we look for old tops (highs on the way up), breakout points (they act as resistance until the breakout-if the breakout is on good volume, it should act as support and give you a bounce).

The assumption is that the stock will continue to move in the same direction following the breakout, which generates a buy or sell signal.

The defination and meaning of Breakout Tests is We often write about stocks that test their breakout prices. Stocks breaking to new highs or out of consolidations often come back to test the breakout point before continuing with the breakout. This is most likely due to certain investors taking profits. If the breakout is a strong one, buyers come back in at some point before the stock falls below the breakout. This starts the stock back up on the next leg. This test can happen the next day, or it can happen after a week of upward movement. That is why we advise those in on the breakout move to watch for a test. If the stock has had a good move, you don?t want to lose profit on a big test-you can always get back in when the stock moves back up. For a small test soon after the break, you can ride it down, but you have to be careful the stock does not fall back within its previous trading range. Good breakout volume is a sign that this is less likely to happen. There are two plays on the breakout test: when the stock turns back up on good volume, or when the stock tops its breakout high. The former is riskier in that the breakout high can act as resistance, but we will play this move if the other indicators are good-volume, money flow, relative strength. The safer play is the break over the recent breakout high as this shows there is no resistance. If the volume is still good, the stock will most likely continue its breakout.

2. Internal rating based approach (IRB) - The IRB approach, on the other hand, allows banks to use their own internal ratings of counterparties and exposures, which permit a finer differentiation of risk for various exposures and hence delivers capital requirements that are better aligned to the degree of risks. The IRB approaches are of two types:
a) Foundation IRB (FIRB): The bank estimates the Probability of Default (PD) associated with each borrower, and the supervisor supplies other inputs such as Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure At Default (EAD).
b) Advanced IRB (AIRB): In addition to Probability of Default (PD), the bank estimates other inputs such as EAD and LGD. The requirements for this approach are more exacting. The adoption of advanced approaches would require the banks to meet minimum requirements relating to internal ratings at the outset and on an ongoing basis such as those relating to the design of the rating system, operations, controls, corporate governance, and estimation and validation of credit risk components, viz., PD for both FIRB and AIRB and LGD and EAD for AIRB.

When a commodity or stock has established a new low, reacts, and moves to a lower low while the corresponding low points on the % of D line make a low and then a higher low, a bullish divergence is indicated.

The defination and meaning of Trading philosophies is There seem to be three major and well defined trading philosophies; contrary opinion, fundamental analysis and technical analysis.

Contrary Opinion: Contrary opinion was first prominently set forth by Neill Humphrey in The Art of Contrary Thinking. Several other texts are also included in the References section. Very simply put, contrary opinion is practiced at market tops and bottoms. It relies heavily on the belief that most traders will be wrongly investing to continue the current trend immediately before a reversal occurs.

Fundamental: A fundamentalist strongly believes that the perception of supply and demand sets the price and direction of market prices. Consistent with this belief, the fundamentalist researches information on inventories, changes in the nature of the consuming market, factors affecting manufacture and delivery, rumors which might affect what other traders currently believe about the condition of supply and demand and a multitude of other data and factors. Fundamental factors vary with commoditiesgrains are affected by weather conditions, current and forecasted, and by government reports; currencies are affected by interest rates and where they are trending, and political conditions. You can see that aggressive fundamental trading requires a great deal of study.

Technical: The pure technical trader relies strictly on price information. This trader would strongly believe that all of the fundamental factors are either already integrated into or are being signaled by the current price patterns. Because of this, the major tool of the technical trader is the price chart; the bar, the candlestick and the Point and Figure Charts.
